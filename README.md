## Documentation

1. Loaded subtitle data from 14.11.17 to 14.6.18
2. Sentiment analysis on content to obtain sentiment feature
3. Took a list of all NYSE stocks and ran their split names through the subtitles content to check for prevlance.
4. Returned table of frequency of company names in videos, picked top 5-15 companines mentioned in the subtitle data (list of all companies that have mentions/occurrences in more than 0.000315 of Youtube Videos) -> plotted patterns of sentiment per ticker
5. Loaded stock ticker data in time range
6. Plotted sentiment against Close price (FedEx and Verizon had -100% correlation)
7. Trained on machine learning models and automatically selected most accurate model for each stock ticker (variables: 'sentiment', 'views', 'likes', 'dislikes', 'comment_count') - used 20% of dataset for training, 80% for strategy evaluation.
8. Set capital of 100,000, transaction quantity as 100 shares and initial trading parameters: we compare current price at each time step to a predicted price (using the respective model) and when buycounter hits 3 or great change in price, then we execute a buy trade (likewise for sell); if there are any outstanding trades on last day, we close the trades.
9. Calculate profit through orderbook mechanism (Display profit per trade as graph). 

Main parameters to optimize model: buy/sell trigger, statistical model, dataset, stock portfolio selection
